Actually, according to GitHub -the Bible of coding-, Javascript is insanely popular, even more than the next two in the list combined (Python and Java)</p> <p><a href=\"https://octoverse.github.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://octoverse.github.com/</a></p> <p>JavaScript, however, can't work on its own end to end. It needs, still in 2018, to be used in combination of other libraries to creating powerful apps.</p> <p>In that respect, ReactJs, owned by Facebook has emerged as the most popular \"UI library\" due to its simplicity and modular nature.</p> <p>We are going to create a webpApp using ReactJs, from scratch. Starting from the basics, we'll follow the most advanced development techniques to build a universal app for mobile, tablet and desktop.</p> <p>We'll cover, in a time-box of 60 minutes, the following aspects:</p> <p>1) Setting up the working environment: tooling, dependencies, etc: Attendees are expected to prepare this upfront.<br/>2) Creating a responsive UI, adapted for multiple devices: We'll talk a bit about this, but please note this is NOT a UX session, so e.g. we aren't going to touch any CSS at all<br/>3) Mastering ReactJS Components: industry patterns, best practices, etc: Yes, that's the main point of the session. We'll also talk a bit about the background of React: why it is so popular, who looks after it and why it 'defeated' its rivals. 4) Navigating through page views: This is beyond the scope of the session. We'd need an entire workshop just to talk about routing - more than happy to look after on a separate session next year, though :)</p> <p>This session will be driven by Ricardo Mallols, who has an intensive coding experience across multiple countries and industries over 15+ years. He's also participated in multiple conferences and events, including a JavaScript talk at an international Google conference.</p> <p>Just RSVP to attend it; don't miss this unique opportunity to learn, for free the most demanded technology in a friendly working environment!</p> <p>How to find the place?

An unprecedented experiment of human faith with outcomes we had yet to discover. The discussions on privacy, security, trust, personal data and governance are becoming fiercer by the day. The loudest critics believe the foundations of the internet were flawed to begin with.</p> <p>But things are changing.</p> <p>Cryptographers, protocol designers and distributed systems engineers have been doing R&amp;D for decades on how computer science could liberate our world, the web and financial systems. With the inception of Bitcoin and Ethereum a larger part of the world is witnessing the first steps into a decentralised world.</p> <p>What are the next steps? Which teams are working on the cutting edge of blockchain and distributed ledger technology and are solving unprecedented challenges in the field of cryptography, consensus mechanisms, protocol design, scalability, security and on-chain governance?</p> <p>During this event we will witness technical showcases from CTO's or technical leads from several different projects.

Desde aquellas primeras, compuestas por criptomonedas, hasta las más recientes conocidas como DLTs que prescinden del concepto de token. Y es probable que en futuro asistamos a nuevas variantes que también se incluyan bajo el paraguas Blockchain .</p> <p>En este meetup vamos a describir cuales son los factores que fomentan y motivan esta diversidad de pensamiento y cómo se traduce en lo que denominamos el circo de la innovación, tanto en el mundo Blockchain y DLT. Intentaremos responder a cuestiones como ¿por qué las grandes empresas necesitan invertir en una imagen de innovación? ¿cómo y por qué se implementan estos programas de innovación? ¿qué ecosistemas e incentivos se crean alrededor de estos ecosistemas? ¿qué dinámicas necesitamos en realidad para ser competitivos en un mundo de transformación acelerada?</p> <p>Además, charlaremos sobre los aspectos fundamentales que hacen de blockchain una de las tecnologías más disruptivas en la actualidad y cómo puede influir en el desarrollo de las personas y las estructuras sociales, en una nueva sociedad \u201cdescentralizada\u201d.</p> <p>En esta ocasión contaremos con Alex Preukschat que realizará una presentación inicial de estos conceptos para después pasar a un debate abierto con el invitado del día: Alberto Gómez Toribio.</p> <p>Alberto es el responsable de tecnología Blockchain en Bankia. Con anterioridad ha trabajado como experto en tecnología para organismos como el Ministerio del Interior o el Tribunal Supremo y en firmas privadas como Sony Entertainment o Telefónica I+D.

This event brings together the Zurich blockchain community and those interested in the topic. 2-3 Blockchain startups from Zurich will give short presentations about their vision for the future - followed by drinks and a get-together.</p> <p>This event is sponsored by BLOCKROCKET (blockrocket.io) - European Blockchain Labs. BLOCKROCKET supports and helps accelerate blockchain startups in launching and growing their business model by providing a platform based on top level co-working facilities in Frankfurt, Munich, and Berlin and connecting them to stakeholders relevant for their startups.</p> <p>TICKETS<br/>++++ The meetup is free of charge but there is a limited number of seats.

As part of the program, he developed an MVP for a Swiss-based retail bank. After his studies, David joined Boydak Strategy Consulting where he focused on business model innovation and rapid prototyping. During this time, David led several projects and developed various MVPs for different clients.</p> <p>(2) Eduardo Salazar, CEO, Forctis AG (<a href=\"https://forctis.io\" class=\"linkified\">https://forctis.io</a>)<br/>An economist engaged in macro-econometrics and applied mathematics, but perhaps more of a technologist on a daily basis, for over 30 years Eduardo has followed a career path involving broadly engaging, cross-disciplinary environments. His experience spans both academia and the private sector, as well as work for multilateral organizations such as the World Bank and the IADB.</p> <p>(3) Nathan Worsley, Co-Founder and CTO, LocalCoinSwap (<a href=\"https://localcoinswap.com/en/\" class=\"linkified\">https://localcoinswap.com/en/</a>)</p> <p>Nathan Worsley is the Co-founder and Chief Technical Officer of LocalCoinSwap. In 2015 he founded the LocalCoinSwap project and was the first developer on the codebase. Although working full time on a technical startup, Nathan's educational background is in Economics and machine learning. Nathan has a passion for using Blockchain as a tool for promoting financial inclusivity. This passion has driven the LocalCoinSwap project to adapt and pivot in the ever-changing regulatory environment to ensure that people from all walks of life have equal access to the world of crypto.</p> <p>AGENDA<br/>18:00h - 18:30h: Entrance<br/>18:30h - 18:40h: Introduction<br/>18:40h - 19:00h: CollectID - Authenticity Through Technology - Once and for All<br/>19:00h - 19:10h: Discussion and Q&amp;A<br/>19:10h - 19:30h: Forctis AG - ARES: Towards a Revolution in Asset Representation<br/>19:30h - 19:40h: Discussion and Q&amp;A<br/>19:40h - 19:50h: Break<br/>19:50h - 20:10h: Enabling Accessibility in Discriminative Crypto Markets<br/>19:40h - 21:00h: Get together/Drinks</p> <p>This meetup will be held in English.</p> ","visibility":"public","pro_is_email_shared":false,"member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1548707419000,"duration":5400000,"id":"gcjqgryzqbxb","name":"Holiday *Ugly Sweater* Lightning-Talk Extravaganza!","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"upcoming","time":1576717200000,"local_date":"2019-12-18","local_time":"18:00","updated":1575740901000,"utc_offset":-25200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":11,"venue":{"id":26572067,"name":"Peregrine Co-working and Crypto Cafe","lat":40.014522552490234,"lon":-105.27857208251953,"repinned":true,"address_1":"1724 Broadway","city":"Boulder","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"80302","state":"CO"},"group":{"created":1495041476000,"name":"Boulder Blockchain Meetup","id":23825560,"join_mode":"open","lat":40.04999923706055,"lon":-105.20999908447266,"urlname":"Boulder-Blockchain","who":"Blocks in the Chain","localized_location":"Boulder, CO","state":"CO","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Mountain"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Boulder-Blockchain/events/gcjqgryzqbxb/","description":"<p>IMPORTANT: THIS IS THE BB HOLIDAY PARTY<br/>1.

Same as Bitcoin, we are resilient and are resurfacing from a long hiatus. Since last year we have seen the bitcoin ecosystem being accepted by the mainstream organizations, and even countries vying for introducing their own digital currencies. In this event we will be summarizing the events briefly and what to expect next.<br/>As the next halving is nearing (ETA 14 May[masked]:23:36), we want to inform ourselves about its meaning and impact on the cryptocurrency prices.</p> <p>A brief intro into \u201cHalving\u201d:</p> <p>Every 4 years on average (210K blocks) the reward granted to Bitcoin miners for adding a block to the blockchain is cut in half. The Bitcoin halving was designed to keep Bitcoin\u2019s inflation in check. If fewer bitcoins are being generated per block mined, the newly increased scarcity automatically makes them more valuable. But this doesn\u2019t happen right away.<br/>Why does Halving affect the price of bitcoin? For that, we need to see the role miners play. About 4,380 blocks are mined each month and added to the bitcoin blockchain. Right now, the block reward is 12.5 BTC, and after the halving event, the block reward will be 6.25 BTC.<br/>When this happens, two scenarios unfold: Miners will simply give up, or they will HODL.<br/>Historically it ends up being a mix of both. Some small number of miners will indeed give up, while the majority will instead choose to keep mining and hold.<br/>The first halving occurred in November 2012, when 1 BTC went for around $11 USD. The following year, the price began to climb dramatically, reaching a new all-time high of over $1,100 in 2013. The price then crashed down to the $220-$240 range, where it would remain for the next few years.<br/>The next halving occurred on July 9, 2016. BTC stayed in the $[masked] range for several months before slowly rising toward the end of the year.</p> <p>Put in simpler words, it comes down to the principle of supply and demand</p> <p>The mission of this event is to help our community learn more about the upcoming halving, and weed out the mistakes that were made in 2017. We will hear from past experiences of people, and ways to avoid the pitfalls.</p> <p>AGENDA</p> <p>6:30 \u2013 7:00 Intro-networking<br/>7:00- 7:15 Meetup presentation<br/>7:15- 8:00 Panel Discussion (Guests to be announced)<br/>8:00- 8:30 Networking</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1574411745000,"duration":86400000,"id":"266658714","name":"Blockchain in Insurance - BLOCKHACK 2019","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"upcoming","time":1575952200000,"local_date":"2019-12-10","local_time":"10:00","rsvp_close_offset":"PT96H","updated":1574412048000,"utc_offset":19800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":5,"venue":{"id":26744640,"name":"10, Kinfra Hi-Tech Park Main Rd","lat":10.055804252624512,"lon":76.35429382324219,"repinned":true,"address_1":"10, Kinfra Hi-Tech Park Main Rd","city":"Kochi","country":"in","localized_country_name":"India"},"group":{"created":1530220769000,"name":"Hyperledger Kerala","id":29021008,"join_mode":"open","lat":8.510000228881836,"lon":76.94999694824219,"urlname":"Hyperledger-Kerala","who":"Members","localized_location":"Thiruvananthapuram, India","state":"","country":"in","region":"en_US","timezone":"Asia/Calcutta"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Hyperledger-Kerala/events/266658714/","description":"<p>Hyperledger Kochi, the meetup group for Hyperledger community members around Kochi, is associating with Kerala Blockchain Academy for a 24 hour live hackathon that is conducted by Allianz Technology and Kerala Blockchain Academy on December 10-11, 2019.</p> <p>The theme of the hackathon is \"Blockchain in Insurance\".</p> <p>Venue : Integrated Startup Complex, Kerala Technology Innovation Zone, Kalamassery , Kochi.</p> <p>Registration is FREE.</p> <p>For more details regarding the hackathon, please visit the website : <a href=\"https://hackathon.blockhash.live/\" class=\"linkified\">https://hackathon.blockhash.live/</a></p> <p>About the Hackathon : Kerala Blockchain Academy in association with Allianz Technology is conducting a 24 hour live hackathon BlockHack2019 on December 10th -11th, 2019 at Integrated Startup Complex (ISC), Kerala Technology Innovation Zone, Kalamassery, Kochi.

Let\u2019s say, To take part in such an insurance program, the client \u201cAwesome Company\u201d has set up their own Captive Insurance company with headquarter in Germany and the insurance policy is expected to be renewed with an annual premium of EUR100m. Afterwards, the headquarter is required to collect the premium portions from all the local offices all over the world. This process is extremely human-intensive as it involves cross-border payment, different banks, time zones, languages. How can we leverage Blockchain / DLT to facilitate this global money movement to improve process transparency, data accuracy and data currency?</p> ","visibility":"public","pro_is_email_shared":false,"member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1569748269000,"duration":25200000,"id":"vsnnjryzqbvb","name":"Blockchain030 | Co-working Mondays | Utrecht Open Blockchain Network","rsvp_limit":16,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"upcoming","time":1576486800000,"local_date":"2019-12-16","local_time":"10:00","updated":1569748269000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":3,"venue":{"id":26604647,"name":"Lisk Center Utrecht","lat":52.08821105957031,"lon":5.107476234436035,"repinned":true,"address_1":"Jaarbeurs Beatrix gebouw - JIM","address_2":"jaarbeursplein","city":"Utrecht","country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands"},"group":{"created":1516022308000,"name":"blockchain030","id":27164245,"join_mode":"open","lat":52.099998474121094,"lon":5.110000133514404,"urlname":"blockchain030","who":"Members","localized_location":"Utrecht, Netherlands","state":"","country":"nl","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Amsterdam"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/blockchain030/events/vsnnjryzqbvb/","description":"<p>It is our goal to stimulate and grow the blockchain community of Utrecht.

We\u2019re creating a place where community members can discuss the premise of the latest smart contracts platform to launch, or introduce their favorite new DeFi project. Who knows - this might be where you and your future co-founders meet.</p> <p>We\u2019re doing this because we feel the need for an objective, non-judgemental, and agenda-free learning environment, which is why we created Cointelligence Academy in the first place.</p> <p>Just like our online platform, in these meetups we will NOT give you investment advice, try to shill a certain coin or project, or be biased towards one project over another. Instead, we will create a neutral environment where all opinions are welcome and the goal is to discuss and share information so everyone can come to their own conclusions.</p> <p>We will not be featuring speakers or keynotes at these events, but we still want them to feel organized rather than chaotic. To that end we will source our agendas from our community.<br/>Before each meetup, Cointelligence Academy community members will be able to suggest topics of conversation, on which the entire community can then vote - and the topics that receive the most votes will be prioritized on the topic list.</p> <p>We are very excited to start seeing faces and talk extensively about our favorite ecosystem, and hope to see you all at the next event.</p> <p>---------------<br/>This event will be held at WeWork Labs.

Decred offers an interesting technology for learning about blockchain and cryptocurrency technology. The group is run by Michael Ghen, an active researcher studying Decred's technology and engineer running full nodes on Decred's testnet.</p> <p># What is Decred?</p> <p>Decred is a decentralized, autonomous digital currency governed directly by its voting stakeholders. Stakeholders vote to decide on consensus rule changes, as well as matters of Treasury and policy. Decred is self-funded by a portion of the block</p> <p># Why is Decred needed?</p> <p>Decred was born from its founders\u2019 experiences with Bitcoin\u2019s governance. Company 0 developed a Bitcoin full node implementation called btcsuite, but the software was not well received by the Bitcoin Core development team. With Bitcoin, the Core developers and Proof-of-Work miners are strong, centralized constituencies that can effectively veto changes to the consensus rules \u2014 other stakeholders in the Bitcoin ecosystem have minimal influence. The absence of a clear method for making decisions results in protracted disputes and chain splits, whereby a sub-community breaks off and creates an alternative version of the currency. This weakens the network effects and dilutes the project\u2019s resources. Bitcoin also has a funding problem, which has been addressed with venture capital investment, bringing with it conflicts of interest. Decred is a better cryptocurrency because it addresses these shortcomings.</p> <p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://decred.org/brief/\" class=\"linkified\">https://decred.org/brief/</a></p> ","how_to_find_us":"Dial GHEN on the call box","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1547306807000,"duration":7200000,"id":"258016210","name":"Blockchain in 2020 - Cybersecurity, Data Custody, Ownership, Monetization","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"upcoming","time":1576542600000,"local_date":"2019-12-16","local_time":"18:30","updated":1575657748000,"utc_offset":-21600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":31,"venue":{"id":20654862,"name":"Capital Factory","lat":30.268739700317383,"lon":-97.74103546142578,"repinned":true,"address_1":"701 Brazos Street","address_2":"Suite 1600","city":"Austin","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"TX"},"group":{"created":1460902978000,"name":"Austin Blockchain Collective Community Meetup","id":19850358,"join_mode":"approval","lat":30.270000457763672,"lon":-97.73999786376953,"urlname":"Austin-Blockchain-Collective-Meetup","who":"Members","localized_location":"Austin, TX","state":"TX","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Central"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Austin-Blockchain-Collective-Meetup/events/258016210/","description":"<p>Based on many recent conversations, common wisdom is that blockchain could contribute to approaches to enhancing and underpinning cyber security and also data custody, ownership and monetization.</p> <p>These are all hot topics that are impacting individuals and corporations and which are likely to increase in importance in 2020.

Das nicht ganz neu, aber mit der Blockchain-Technologie entstehen jetzt ganz neue Möglichkeiten. Es tut sich viel in diesem spannenden Feld der Blockchain-Szene. Im Meetup geben wir Dir einen Überblick und die Möglichkeit, zwei Projekte näher kennen zu lernen.</p> <p>Zum Einstieg geben wir Euch einen Überblick über unterschiedliche Ansätze und Erfolgsbedingungen von Blockchain-basierte Gemeinschaftswährungen (Community Currencies).</p> <p>Dann stellen sich zwei Projekte vor:</p> <p>1.) Coinsence Projekt<br/>ist eine dezentrale Plattform zur Förderung von Zusammenarbeit in einer Geme inschaft. Mit Hilfe einer Blockchain erhält jeder Teilnehmer einen Anteil der Gemeinschaftswährung, die in Projekte investiert und gegen Leistungen und Güter eingetauscht werden können. Coinsence wird derzeit in Tunesien pilotiert.</p> <p>2.) Trustlines Projekt<br/>Trustlines ist eine Blockchain-Lösung, mit der Geldbeträge zwischen Menschen, die sich vertrauen, abgerechnet werden können. Durch die Blockchain entsteht daraus ein Vertrauensnetz, durch das die finanzielle und wirtschaftliche Integration von Menschen gefördert werden kann.</p> <p>Wie immer gibt es genug Zeit für Fragen und Diskussionen.</p> <p>Grüße,<br/>Ronald, Nhan, Krystian &amp; Felix</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1575302817000,"duration":7200000,"id":"266893972","name":"XXV митап Сообщества блокчейн-разработчиков Санкт-Петербурга","rsvp_limit":1000,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"upcoming","time":1576857600000,"local_date":"2019-12-20","local_time":"19:00","updated":1575302834000,"utc_offset":10800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":9,"venue":{"id":26386812,"name":"ONLINE CONFERENCE","lat":59.985435485839844,"lon":30.3011474609375,"repinned":true,"address_1":"1, Blackriver","city":"St. Petersburg","country":"ru","localized_country_name":"Russia"},"group":{"created":1500394426000,"name":"St. Petersburg BlockChain Community Meetup","id":25036597,"join_mode":"open","lat":59.93000030517578,"lon":30.31999969482422,"urlname":"St-Petersburg-BlockChain-Community-Meetup","who":"Members","localized_location":"St. Petersburg, Russia","state":"","country":"ru","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Moscow"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/St-Petersburg-BlockChain-Community-Meetup/events/266893972/","description":"<p>Встреча лучших специалистов в области блокчейн-технологий и не только.

Paybase clients include European platform businesses particularly in the gig, supply chain and blockchain spaces.<br/>Nick will be speaking on the subject of \u201cNetwork effects and blockchains: what can blockchain businesses learn from Deliveroo, Craigslist and Uber\u201d.</p> <p>Could a business using the blockchain technology like Ripple or BeefChain learn from a platform like Deliveroo? Actually, it could, according to Nick. They are both aligned on their reliance on strong network effects, a critical requirement for either to succeed. Features like escrow and smart, frictionless transactions are effective strategies used by platform businesses - and they can be key to a blockchain business reaching its disruptive potential.</p> <p>Nick is particularly interested in nurturing network effects, reducing disintermediation across platforms and hearing about the platform businesses of tomorrow. Paybase are the only provider in Europe to simultaneously allow their clients to build compliant escrow flows and to execute card-to-worker bank account payments in under 30 seconds, providing a true cashless transaction experience for gig economy platforms.</p> <p>Drinks and nibbles provided as usual.<br/>Can't wait to see you there!</p> <p>Massive THANK YOU to our sponsors:<br/>ConsenSys for the venue and<br/>Hydrogen Group for the drinks!</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1550607058000,"duration":10800000,"id":"kjjcsqyzqbvb","name":"CryptoMonday | Bitcoin & Blockchain Münster","rsvp_limit":50,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"upcoming","time":1576515600000,"local_date":"2019-12-16","local_time":"18:00","updated":1550607058000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":5,"venue":{"id":25305370,"name":"Digital Hub münsterLAND","lat":51.952186584472656,"lon":7.640487194061279,"repinned":true,"address_1":"Hafenweg 16","city":"Münster","country":"de","localized_country_name":"Germany"},"group":{"created":1454485632000,"name":"CryptoMonday | Blockchain Münster","id":19498539,"join_mode":"open","lat":51.959999084472656,"lon":7.619999885559082,"urlname":"Munster-Blockchain-Meetup","who":"Bitcoiner & Blockchainer","localized_location":"Münster, Germany","state":"","country":"de","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Berlin"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Munster-Blockchain-Meetup/events/kjjcsqyzqbvb/","description":"<p>THEMA<br/>Hallo und herzlich Willkommen zum CryptoMonday, dem größten Blockchain, Bitcoin &amp; Crypto Meetup Deutschlands.</p> <p>Hier wird in kürze das Thema des Abends vorgestellt</p> <p>Bei unseren Meetups geht es um das Thema Bitcoin, Blockchain, Technologie, Cryptos, Smart Contracts, dApps, Investing und alles was sich darum abspielt.
