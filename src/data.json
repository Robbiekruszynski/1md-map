With his team, he is building the Honeycomb<br/>Marketplace, which allows developers to easily connect their smart<br/>contracts to some of the world's premier API providers.</p> <p>About Honeycomb:<br/>Honeycomb is an API marketplace purpose-built for connecting smart<br/>contracts to high-quality external data inputs from some of the world's<br/>premier data providers. Smart contracts can query APIs on Honeycomb via<br/>decentralized Chainlink oracles, allowing the contract to execute in a<br/>highly reliable, end-to-end secure manner on networks such as Ethereum,<br/>Bitcoin and Hyperledger.</p> <p>Visit Honeycomb at: <a href=\"https://honeycomb.market/\" class=\"linkified\">https://honeycomb.market/</a></p> <p>About Chainlink<br/>Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that enables smart contracts to securely access off-chain data feeds, web APIs, and traditional bank payments. Chainlink is consistently selected as one of the top blockchain technologies by leading independent research firms such as Gartner. It is well known for providing highly secure and reliable oracles to both large enterprises (SWIFT Google, Oracle) and leading smart contract development teams (Web3 Foundation, OpenLaw, Zeppelin, MARKET Protocol, and more).</p> <p>We've been providing secure and reliable oracles to great companies like Google, Oracle, SWIFT, and many other large enterprises, as well as many of the world's best smart contract projects/teams such as Web3, Hedera, Reserve, OpenZeppelin, OpenLaw, Celer, Synthetix, Zilliqa, OceanProtocol, Amberdata, Kaleido, Harmony, ThunderCore, and many more.</p> <p>About CLC Group<br/>CLC Group is a blockchain lab focused on developing real-world connected smart contract solutions for a more trustless, efficient and secure future.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"dLab.VC (between 7th & 8th Ave)  on Floor 3","visibility":"public","pro_is_email_shared":false,"member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1569440921000,"duration":9000000,"id":"gsbljryzqbfc","name":"⚡NYC Blockchain Devs Study Group⚡","rsvp_limit":85,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"upcoming","time":1577143800000,"local_date":"2019-12-23","local_time":"18:30","updated":1569440921000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":2,"venue":{"id":24538509,"name":"WeWork Dumbo Heights","lat":40.700862884521484,"lon":-73.98747253417969,"repinned":true,"address_1":"81 Prospect St","city":"Brooklyn","country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","phone":"+16469789915"},"group":{"created":1460157055000,"name":"NYC Blockchain Devs","id":19817557,"join_mode":"open","lat":40.689998626708984,"lon":-74.01000213623047,"urlname":"nyc-blockchain-devs","who":"Members","localized_location":"New York, NY","state":"NY","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/nyc-blockchain-devs/events/gsbljryzqbfc/","description":"<p>The Flatiron School // Access Labs are proud to support the NYC Blockchain Devs. This is a regular gathering for Blockchain Devs of all levels to learn, present, work on in collaboration with one another or on solo projects in this fast-growing field.

Similarly, router nodes (those forwarding payments in the Lightning Network (LN)) are compensated with transaction fees. However it is not well understood whether this financial incentive is comparable to the miner's incentives. Ferenc will talk about how much currently routers gain from providing services on the Lightning Network and why little financial incentives are problematic. In this talk we will also hear about more the privacy shortcomings of LN.</p> <p>About Ferenc Beres:</p> <p>PhD student in Computer Science who works at the Informatics Laboratory of the Institute for Computer Science and Control (SZTAKI).

Here's a video with some very basic preparation tasks, to ensuring your laptop is ready to start working with React from the 1st minute:<br/><a href=\"https://kodiri.com/platform/videos/meetup-reactjs\" class=\"linkified\">https://kodiri.com/platform/videos/meetup-reactjs</a><br/>(Please only look after the first video, as we'll cover the rest during the session :))</p> <p>Do you know which is the most popular programming language today?</p> <p>It's JavaScript! Actually, according to GitHub -the Bible of coding-, Javascript is insanely popular, even more than the next two in the list combined (Python and Java)</p> <p><a href=\"https://octoverse.github.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://octoverse.github.com/</a></p> <p>JavaScript, however, can't work on its own end to end. It needs, still in 2018, to be used in combination of other libraries to creating powerful apps.</p> <p>In that respect, ReactJs, owned by Facebook has emerged as the most popular \"UI library\" due to its simplicity and modular nature.</p> <p>We are going to create a webpApp using ReactJs, from scratch. Starting from the basics, we'll follow the most advanced development techniques to build a universal app for mobile, tablet and desktop.</p> <p>We'll cover, in a time-box of 60 minutes, the following aspects:</p> <p>1) Setting up the working environment: tooling, dependencies, etc: Attendees are expected to prepare this upfront.<br/>2) Creating a responsive UI, adapted for multiple devices: We'll talk a bit about this, but please note this is NOT a UX session, so e.g. we aren't going to touch any CSS at all<br/>3) Mastering ReactJS Components: industry patterns, best practices, etc: Yes, that's the main point of the session. We'll also talk a bit about the background of React: why it is so popular, who looks after it and why it 'defeated' its rivals. 4) Navigating through page views: This is beyond the scope of the session. We'd need an entire workshop just to talk about routing - more than happy to look after on a separate session next year, though :)</p> <p>This session will be driven by Ricardo Mallols, who has an intensive coding experience across multiple countries and industries over 15+ years. He's also participated in multiple conferences and events, including a JavaScript talk at an international Google conference.</p> <p>Just RSVP to attend it; don't miss this unique opportunity to learn, for free the most demanded technology in a friendly working environment!</p> <p>How to find the place?

We think the possibility to build WebAssemblies, the ability to code in C# instead of JavaScript and the server and client mode.<br/>Martin Kräuchi will show you the key elements of Blazor in a practical step by step approach (no C# knowledge necessary). By interest he also will give us a glimpse to azure storage queues and azure serverless computing (azure functions).<br/>Bring in your laptop, food and drinks are offered.
